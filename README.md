## About me
* Software engineer driven by a passion for continuous learning, problem-solving, and collaboration.
* I thrive in environments where creativity and teamwork come together, and I’m always excited to learn from others while contributing my expertise.
* I have two years of experience, focusing on .NET, JavaScript (React and Playwright), and python.
* During this time, I am proud to have delivered projects across a wide range of sub-fields, including; a CI/CD pipeline, automation tools, and web development.
* Outside of work, you’ll often find me rock climbing, hiking, or learning Korean—a mix of activities that keep me active and curious!
